# Conways-Game-of-Life

I was introduced to Conway's Game of Life as part of my coursework at General Assembly. It was presented as a challenge problem and we were intentionally given an insufficient amount of time to complete it. Following my completion of the program, I decided to revisit the problem. My goal was to utilize some of the more modern features of HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox and animations) and ES6 (classes). 

There are four simple rules to Conway's Game of Life:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation or exposure).
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation or overcrowding).
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life.

To run the simulation, the user clicks on squares to set their initial status as 'alive' and then clicks on 'run'. Try experimenting with different formations to discover interesting visual patterns!
